## ⚡ Key Features (Aligned with Industry Standards)

* **State Management:** Managed application state for `loading` indicators and data population to optimize the User Experience (UX) during network latency.
* **Clean Code Principles:** Followed component-based architecture to ensure code reusability and maintainability.
